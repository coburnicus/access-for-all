<h3 id="toc_3">Scholarships for In-Person Trainings</h3>
<p>Under the management of BCT Partners, the CDFI Fund will cover travel costs for participants with the stipulation that a maximum of 35 people can attend each training, per the contract.</p>

<h4>Prioritizing Attendance</h4>

<p>When a prospective training attendee registers, their participation must be confirmed in order to attend the training. If no more than 35 people register for a training, then all registrants will be registered pending the CDFI Fund’s approval. If more than 35 people register for a training, the following prioritization process will apply until the class is full:
<ul>
 <li>Registrants will be approved on a first come-first served basis (i.e. in order of registration).

<li>There will be an initial limit of one staff member per CDFI. For in-person trainings 2 and 3, priority will be given to registrants that have not previously attended a training.

<li>If space is still available, a second staff member per CDFI will be approved, in order of registration, from among the remaining pool of registrants. Once again, for in-person trainings 2 and 3, priority will be given to registrants that have not previously attended a training.

<li>If space is still available, additional staff members per CDFI will be approved, in order of registration, from among the remaining pool of registrants. Once again, for in-person trainings 2 and 3, priority will be given to registrants that have not previously attended a training.
</ul>
<p>If a training is oversubscribed, a waiting list will be established and registrants on the waiting list will be moved to the registrant list in accordance with the above prioritization plan and will notified if/when space becomes available.</p>

<h4>Scholarship Approval</h4>

<p>Each CDFI may submit a lodging and travel scholarship request for up to two individuals. Scholarships will be approved on a first come-first served basis. There will be an initial limit of one staff member per CDFI. If space is available, a second staff member from a CDFI may also receive a scholarship on a first come-first served basis from among the remaining pool of applicants.</p>

<p>Participants that are local to the city where an in-person training is being held – within a distance of less than 50 miles from the hotel – will not be eligible for a scholarship. Participants that are traveling a distance of 50 miles or more will be eligible for a scholarship.</p>
